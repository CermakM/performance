Benchmark Scripts
-----------------

This repository contains a set of scripts that can be used directly by Amun to
benchmark an application stack. This application stack can be supplied directly
by user (to verify its stack performance) or can be generated by Dependency
Monkey to gather software stack characteristics.

Usage
=====

Amun accepts an URL to the script (or you can submit it verbatim as a string)
to Amun API as part of the request (parameter ``script``).

To use script directly from GitHub, you can open the given script to view its
content and than click on "Raw" button in the GitHub's file header to obtain an
URL to a raw script file. Use the URL to as the ``script`` parameter on Amun
API (do not pass directly "non-raw" URL as Amun will download HTML page instead
of raw file content).

Writing a benchmark script
==========================


The benchmark script should be directly executable (e.g. ``python3
script.py``), it can print additional information onto ``stderr`` in any form
(this output is captured by Amun for additional analaysis). The output written
onto ``stdout`` *has to be* in a JSON format with any keys and values the
script wants to capture. To automatically submit results into Thoth's
knowledge base, there is expected key ``performance_index`` key which value has
to be from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusively. This number states how well the given
application performs in the benchmark run.
