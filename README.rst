Benchmark Scripts
-----------------

This repository contains a set of scripts that can be used directly by Amun to
benchmark an application stack. This application stack can be supplied directly
by user (to verify its stack performance) or can be generated by Dependency
Monkey to gather software stack characteristics.

Usage
=====

Amun accepts an URL to the script (or you can submit it verbatim as a string)
to Amun API as part of the request (parameter ``script``).

To use script directly from GitHub, you can open the given script to view its
content and than click on "Raw" button in the GitHub's file header to obtain an
URL to a raw script file. Use the URL to as the ``script`` parameter on Amun
API (do not pass directly "non-raw" URL as Amun will download HTML page instead
of raw file content).
